After opening the screen for creating app, for now, you can choose between 12 templates, but stay tuned, new templates are coming soon. Templates have already created an app with the basic sections \(ex: Conference template contains: agenda, the location where the conference is, buy a tickets section, social and etc\). You can add or delete a section, it's up to your needs. 

Additionally the selected template will be downloaded locally and later we will explain more about that.

Next, you have to choose a layout. For now, there are two layouts \(**tabs** and **side**\). But very soon **grid** layout will be included.

Now find the template file which was downloaded before and after choosing the app layout you need to follow several required steps before creating the app. 

1. **OPEN FILE UPLOADER IN YOUR GOOGLE SPREADSHEET DIRECTORY**
2. **UPLOAD THE FILE YOU'VE DOWNLOADED**
3. **PUBLISH FILE TO THE WEB**
4. **COPY AND PASTE THE SPREADSHEET ID**

On the last step there is input for entering the Sreadsheet ID that will be generated after finishing previous steps.
