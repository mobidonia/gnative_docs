After opening the screen for creating app, for now, you can choose between 12 templates, but stay tuned, new templates are coming soon. Templates have already created an app with the basic sections \(ex: Conference template contains: agenda, the location where the conference is, buy a tickets section, social and etc\). You can add or delete a section, it's up to your needs. 

Additionally the selected template will be downloaded locally and later we will explain more about that.
