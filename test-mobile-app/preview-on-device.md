# Preview app on Device

Because of the interest from our clients there is additional option for testing the app on mobile device.

This is not required so if you want this option you will need to buy our [Preview App](https://codecanyon.net/item/preview-app-for-react-app-builder/24878250) from CodeCanyon.

After downloading the source code you will need to [follow the steps](https://mobidonia.support-hub.io/articles/install-rab-app-preview-app-1493) for installing the Preview App.

Soon after you will have an official preview app on Play Store or App Store you can update the links.
